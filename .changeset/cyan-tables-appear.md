This release adds support for both esm and commonjs for newer versions of Next. Esbuild and necessary build step was added to ensure cjs/esm output. Typescript support also added via jsdocs. The plugin now includes the typings for .graphql/.gql file extentions, and also include the necessary declaration files to add types to the plugin.
